# Introduction

The Credit Protocol is a powerful blockchain solution to storing credits and debts on the blockchain.  This doc will help walk you through interacting with and integrating the Credit Protocol into your UCAC (use case authority contract) which will be built atop the protocol.  All docs here refer to the most updated version of the protocol at https://github.com/blockmason/credit-protocol
